2. Structure and Format
- Start each section with a clear purpose statement
- Break information into digestible chunks
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for steps
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 lines maximum)
- Include relevant examples for complex concepts
- Use headers and subheaders for easy scanning

3. Content Guidelines
- Focus on "what" and "how" rather than technical "why"
- Start with common use cases before advanced features
- Include practical examples related to daily digest usage
- When explaining features, lead with the benefit to the user
- Use real-world analogies when explaining complex concepts

4. Visual Elements
- Use screenshots when explaining UI elements
- Add callouts to highlight important interface elements

DON'T:
- Assume technical knowledge
- Use complex technical analogies
- Write long, unbroken blocks of text
- Use industry-specific abbreviations without explanation

6. Examples Format
- Show practical examples that relate to daily digest usage
- Structure examples as: Problem → Solution → Result
- Include both basic and slightly advanced use cases
- Use realistic scenarios that users can relate to
