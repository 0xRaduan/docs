## 1. Setup your summate address

Once you log in to Summate and start the onboarding process, you will be asked to set up your Summate address(`@inbox.summate.io`).

This is the email address that you will use to subscribe to newsletters or [auto-forward them from your main inbox](/essentials/auto-forwarding).

## 2. Subscribing to newsletters

Once the `@inbox.summate.io` address is set up, you can start subscribing to newsletters. We do have [recommendations list](/useful-links/ai), but you are free to subscribe to any newsletter you want!

## 3. Receiving first Digest

Once you've added your first newsletters and [they have been approved](/essentials/managing-newsletters#basic-concepts), or altenatively you've added [other sources](/essentials/other-sources), you will receive your first digest on the next day.

It is typically being sent on **11 AM UTC**. It might take some time for it to be delivered. Alternatively, you can open [digests page](https://summate.io/digests) in your dashboard past **11AM UTC** and should see it there.

You can also setup cadence for [receiving digests](/essentials/customizing-digests).

## Optional: Connect Substack or YouTube account

Alternatively to adding newsletters, we support several other sources: _RSS_, _YouTube_, _Substack_. For [YouTube](/integrations/youtube) and [Substack](/integrations/substack), we provide options for quickly retrieving your subscriptions..

## Support

If you are having trouble with something, we do recommend checking [FAQ](/faq) section of documentation or [contacting us directly](mailto:support@summate.io).
