## How Can I Subscribe to Paid Newsletters?

Summate has 2 ways to subscribe to any type of newsletter:

- via [AI Inbox](/essentials/ai-inbox)
- via [Other Sources](/essentials/other-sources), if it's a substack newsletter.

Other Sources will only subscribed you to a public part of a paid newsletter. In this case, the only available option is [AI Inbox](/essentials/ai-inbox).

When subscribing with ai inbox, you can do 2 things: subscribe directly with your `@inbox.summate.io` email address or subscribe with your normal email address and then setup forwarding of those paid newsletters to your `@inbox.summate.io` email address.

We _recommend_ second option, as it gives you more flexibility.
