Summate integrates with Substack.

In case you want all of your substack subscriptions to send emails to your new [AI Inbox](/essentials/ai-inbox), you can [change your substack email](#change-substack-email) to it.

We've also developed a special sync-integration, where you can add all newsletters you read in one click. It's available during onboarding and also as part of [settings](/essentials/settings).

## Change Substack Email

Please head to [substack.com/account/email](https://substack.com/account/email) and change your email to your [AI Inbox](/essentials/ai-inbox) email(the one that has `@inbox.summate.io` in it).

## Connecting Your Substack Account

#### 1. Find your profile URL.

You need to navigate to substack.com and then click on your profile.

<Frame>
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-10 items-center">
    <img
      src="/images/substack/substack_connect_1.png"
      alt="Substack Find Profile"
    />
    <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9em", fontStyle: "italic", textAlign: "center" }}>
      Click on your icon and then on your name
    </p>
  </div>
</Frame>

#### 2. Verify that your 'Reads' section is public.

In order for us to fetch your Substack Subscriptions, you need to make 'Reads' section public.

<Frame>
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-10 items-center">
    <img
      src="/images/substack/substack_connect_2_1.png"
      alt="Substack Verify Reads"
    />
    <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9em", fontStyle: "italic", textAlign: "center" }}>
      Example Profile
    </p>
  </div>
</Frame>

You can do so by clicking on **'Edit Profile'** and then scrolling down to the **'Reads'** section. In it you can decide which newsletters you want to make public.

> _Note: You need to make it public just when connecting your Substack account. After you synced your substack with Summate, you can make it private again._

<Frame>
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-10 items-center">
    <img
      src="/images/substack/substack_connect_2_2.png"
      alt="Substack Verify Reads"
    />
    <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9em", fontStyle: "italic", textAlign: "center" }}>
      How to make your reads private or public
    </p>
  </div>
</Frame>

#### 3. Connect Your Substack Account on Summate

After the preparations are done on the Substack end, please head back to Summate. If you are reading this during onboarding, you can see the **'Connect Substack'** button. It's also available in the [Integrations Tab in Settings](/essentials/settings).

<Frame>
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-10 items-center">
    <img
      src="/images/substack/substack_connect_3_1.png"
      alt="Substack Connect Button"
    />
    <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9em", fontStyle: "italic", textAlign: "center" }}>
      Connect Substack Button
    </p>
  </div>
</Frame>

After that you need to enter URL of your profile to the input field. It should be in the next format: `https://substack.com/@<username>` or `https://substack.com/profile/<username>`.

<Frame>
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-10 items-center">
    <img
      src="/images/substack/substack_connect_3_2.png"
      alt="Substack Connect Input"
    />
    <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9em", fontStyle: "italic", textAlign: "center" }}>
      Please input a valid substack profile URL
    </p>
  </div>
</Frame>

After that it will fetch all your public subscriptions, and you can select which ones you want to sync.

<Frame>
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-10 items-center">
    <img
      src="/images/substack/substack_connect_3_3.png"
      alt="Substack Connect Subscriptions"
    />
    <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9em", fontStyle: "italic", textAlign: "center" }}>
      Select which subscriptions you want to sync.
    </p>
  </div>
</Frame>

After you do so, you will be able to see all the selected subscriptions in the [Other Sources](/essentials/other-sources) page.
