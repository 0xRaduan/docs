Besides manual addition of youtube channels, you can also subscribe to channels via our YouTube integration.

It connects to your YouTube account, fetches all of your subscriptions and lets you choose which ones you want to get summaries for.

#### 1. Initiate Connection Process

Whether during onboarding or on [integrations page](/essentials/settings#integrations), you will see a "Connect with YouTube" button.

Clicking on it will redirect you to a new page where you can authorize Summate to access your YouTube account.

#### 2. Choosing YouTube Channels

After you go through Google's authorization process, you will be redirected back to Summate.

On the next page, you will see a list of all your YouTube channels. You can choose which ones you want to subscribe to and click **"Connect Sources"** button.
