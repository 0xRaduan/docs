Summate's Save for Later feature allows you to save any website or YouTube video to read later. The content will be automatically summarized and resurfaced in your Summate Digest, helping you stay on top of your reading list.

## How it Works

When browsing the web with the Summate extension, you can:

1. Save any article or video for later reading
2. Access your saved content in the Summate dashboard
3. Receive AI-powered summaries in your Summate Digest
4. Share content with others, even if it's behind a paywall
5. Organize your saved items with archive and delete options

## Saving Content

To save content for later:

1. Click the Summate extension button or use the keyboard shortcut `âŒ˜ CMD + Shift + Y`
2. In the sidebar, click the "Save for Later" button
3. The content will be saved to your Summate dashboard and queued for summarization

<Note>
  You can save any type of content - articles, blog posts, YouTube videos, and
  even paywalled content.

1. Visit [Summate Dashboard](https://summate.io/dashboard) to access your saved items
2. View AI-generated summaries of your saved content
3. Organize your content:
   - Archive items you've finished reading
   - Delete items you no longer need
   - Mark items as read/unread

{/* TODO: Add a GIF demonstrating the content management actions (archive, delete, mark as read) */}

### In Summate Digest

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of how saved items appear in the Summate Digest */}

Your saved content will be intelligently resurfaced in your Summate Digest, helping you:

- Discover content you saved but haven't read yet
- Get AI-powered summaries to quickly decide if you want to read the full content
- Stay on top of your reading list without feeling overwhelmed

## Sharing Content

{/* TODO: Add GIF showing the complete sharing flow - from clicking share to the recipient view */}

One of the powerful features of Save for Later is the ability to share content with others:

1. Find the content you want to share in your dashboard
2. Click the "Share" button
3. Get a shareable link that works even for paywalled content
4. Recipients can view both the original content and its AI-generated summary

{/* TODO: Add side-by-side screenshots showing the shared content view for both paywalled and non-paywalled content */}

<Note>
  When you share paywalled content, recipients can access it without needing a
  subscription to the original site.
