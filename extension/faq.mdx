## Is this Free?

We would love to keep it free for everyone, however currently our sole focus is on the users who are paid subscribers of Summate.

We will eventually revisit this decision.

## How much summary credits do I get?

Users of essential plan get 100 summary credits per month, users of Pro plan get 500 summary credits per month and users of Unlimited plan get unlimited summary credits per month.

## How accurate are the summaries?

We strive to provide as accurate summaries as possible, however sometimes the summaries might not be 100% accurate. Always refer back to the original article or the video segment.
