Currently, there are only 2 settings that are available for Chrome Extension:

- Language of the Summary
- Whether extension is active on a certain website.

## Choosing Language of the Summary

In order to choose language of the summary, you need to go to the [settings page](https://summate.io/settings/notifications) and select language from the dropdown.

Same language applies to both digests and summaries via extension.

For support of other languages, please submit them [here](https://summate.canny.io/feature-requests).

## Choose Where Summate Extension is Active

We know that on some websites it might be inconvenient to see a Summarize button, and therefore added an option to disable extension on a certain website.

Please click on the extension icon and select "Disable on this website" option.

  <div className="flex flex-col gap-10 items-center">
    <img
      src="/images/extension/extension_disable_site.png"
      alt="Disable Extension on a website"
      className="rounded-lg"
    />
    <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9em", fontStyle: "italic", textAlign: "center" }}>
      Disable Extension on a certain website
    </p>
  </div>
</Frame>

It will be disabled for that website only. If you want to re-enable it, you can do so by clicking on the extension icon and selecting "Enable on this website" option.

  <div className="flex flex-col gap-10 items-center">
    <img
      src="/images/extension/extension_enable_site.png"
      alt="Enable Extension on a website"
      className="rounded-lg"
    />
    <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9em", fontStyle: "italic", textAlign: "center" }}>
      Enable Extension on a certain website
    </p>
  </div>
