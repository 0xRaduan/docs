## Supported Sources

We are currently supporting 3 types of sources, which can be added via [Other Sources](https://summate.io/sources) page: [YouTube](#youtube), [Substack](#substack) and [RSS](#rss).

## YouTube

You can subscribe to any youtube channel and receive summaries of the videos they publish.
Just head to [Other Sources](https://summate.io/sources) page, click "Add Source" and paste the URL of the channel you want to subscribe to.
Accepted formats:

- `https://youtube.com/@username`
- `https://www.youtube.com/channel/channel_id`

<Frame>
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-10 items-center">
    <img
      src="/images/other-sources/youtube_add_1.png"
      alt="Step 1 - click 'Add Source'"
      style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
    />
    <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9em", fontStyle: "italic", textAlign: "center" }}>
      Click "Add Source"
    </p>
    <img
      src="/images/other-sources/youtube_add_2.png"
      alt="Step 2 - paste the URL of the channel you want to subscribe to"
      style={{ marginTop: "4px", borderRadius: "8px" }}
    />
    <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9em", fontStyle: "italic", textAlign: "center" }}>
      Paste the URL of the channel you want to subscribe to
    </p>
  </div>
</Frame>
## Substack

Same as for [YouTube](#youtube), you can subscribe to any substack blog and receive summaries of the posts they publish.

This is alternative method to using [AI inbox](/essentials/ai-inbox), but it allows you to quickly add Substack blogs you follow. This method is typically used when adding subscriptions via [Substack Integration](/integrations/substack).

You can just paste the URL of the main page of the substack blog in order to get subscribed to it.

## RSS

Summate also supports following any website or blog that contains an RSS feed.
If you are not familiar with [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS), you can try to find a feed of your favourite website like this: `<websiteName> RSS feed`.

Typically, if it does support RSS feeds, you will be able to find the relevant URL.

After you find it - you can add it also as a source - Summate will get subscribed to it.
