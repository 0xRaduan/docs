## Overview

Instead of subscribing to all newsletters manually again, you can set up auto-forwarding and send a copy of selected newsletters from your main inbox, automatically.

The overall process typically takes about 5 minutes of time, and generally requires two things:

- add your `@inbox.summate.io` email to your approved forwarding addresses
- setup filters to forward newsletters to your `@inbox.summate.io` email

## Step-by-step guide for Gmail

### 1. Go to Gmail Settings

  />
</Frame>

### 3. Add a new Forwarding Address

<Warning>
**Do NOT select the ‚ÄúForward a copy of incoming mail to ‚Ä¶‚Äù option!**

Instead, setup filtering with forwarding([step 8 of the guide](/essentials/auto-forwarding#8-setting-up-filtering))

**Otherwise, all of your emails will be forwarded to the summate inbox, and that can be annoying or compromising data to the LLMs which you do not want to compromise.**

</Warning>

### 4. Enter your summate email inbox

You should have created it during the onboarding. If you haven't please go to the [inbox page](https://summate.io/inbox) and do that.

### 5. Authorize your request via Gmail

You might need to verify that it‚Äôs you(go through 2FA process with Gmail).

After that, Gmail will send a verification link to your [summate inbox](https://summate.io/inbox).

### 6. Find an email for gmail verification

You will receive an email to your summate address. Navigate to [your inbox](https://summate.io/inbox) and you will see a new sender in pending section. After you click on it, you will see something similar to the image below:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/auto-forwarding/step_6.png"
    alt="Step 6 - verify your summate address for gmail auto-forwarding"
  />
</Frame>

### 7. Paste the verification link into your browser

Once you open the email, you will see something similar to the screenshot below. You need to copy and paste the link provided there into your browser.
It should be along the lines: `https://mail-settings.google.com/mail/...`

<Frame>
  <img

    alt="Step 7 - paste the verification link into your browser"
  />
</Frame>

### 8. Setting up filtering

Once your summate email address was approved for gmail forwarding, you can setup as much filters as you want and choose to auto-forward emails to your summate inbox as a setting on those filters.

First, go to the ‚Äúfilters and blocked addresses‚Äù page.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/auto-forwarding/step_8_1.png"
    alt="Step 8 - go to the filters and blocked addresses page"
  />
</Frame>

Then, create a new filter:

For example a simple one to catch all emails from one address.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/auto-forwarding/step_8_2.png"
    alt="Step 8 - create a new filter"
  />
</Frame>

Click continue, and choose exactly what you want to do with these emails(I prefer to mark them read and also keep them in main inbox).
**Make sure to choose ‚Äúforward it to‚Äù option, and specify your summate inbox as a forwarding option.**

Once you click create filter, your new emails that match criteria specified by this filter will be automatically forwarded to your [summate inbox](https://summate.io/inbox).

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/auto-forwarding/step_8_3.png"
    alt="Step 8 - choose exactly what you want to do with these emails"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  [By default](/essentials/managing-newsletters#basic-concepts) you need to approve every new sender to your summate inbox, because
  we want to prevent you from having spam getting into digests or spending your
  summary credits.

However, for auto-forwarding setup, you need to approve only first sender, and all
subsequent senders will be auto-approved, as we recognize your main email address
in already approved senders.

</Note>

### Recommended filters setup

To make your life easier, here are some easy ideas for filters, that will save you a ton of time:

- If you read many **substack** newsletters, setup sender to be `substack.com`
- If you read many **beehiiv** newsletters, setup sender to be `beehiiv.com`
- Typically all newsletters contain `Unsubscribe` link in the footer, so you can put `has the word "unsubscribe" in the words` condition to catch all newsletters across your inbox.

- **Outlook:** please check [this guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/turn-on-automatic-forwarding-in-outlook-7f2670a1-7fff-4475-8a3c-5822d63b0c8e), but in essence it should be similar to Gmail.
- **iCloud:** please check [this guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/automatically-forward-email-mm6b1a3960/icloud), but in essence it should be similar to Gmail.
