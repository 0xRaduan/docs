## Basic Concepts

You can view all of the newsletters through your [inbox](https://summate.io/inbox).

By default, you will see three different sections: _Pending_, _Approved_ and _Blocked_.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/inbox_basic.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

- **Pending**: These are the newsletters, that have sent you a message, but you haven't approved them yet. _They will **NOT** be included in your digests._
- **Approved**: These are the newsletters that you have confirmed your email address for. _They will be included in your digests._
- **Blocked**: These are the newsletters that you have blocked. _They will **NOT** be included in your digests._

## Subscribing To Newsletters

Once you go through onboarding process, you will be able to subscribe to newsletters via your `@inbox.summate.io` email address, that you have created.
Think about it as your personal inbox, just for newsletters.

From there, you have 2 options: [Setup auto-forwarding](/essentials/auto-forwarding) or manually add newsletters.

- Option 1 is recommended, as it will save you time, and we do provide [some recommendations on the filters](/essentials/auto-forwarding#recommended-filters-setup) to set it up efficiently.
- Option 2 is more manual, but will give you more control over what you receive. To get you up to speed, we provide a [list of recommended newsletters](/useful-links/ai).

Both options are **security-focused**, as they do not access your email inbox directly.

However, if you want to get one-click integration with Gmail in the future, please vote on [this roadmap item](https://summate.canny.io/feature-requests/p/integration-with-gmail).

## Blocking Newsletters

Blocking Newsletters is a great way to get rid of newsletters that you don't want to receive as a part of your daily digest.

You can do this by either blocking them via the [inbox page](https://summate.io/inbox):

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/inbox_main_block.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

Or you can alternatively block the newsletter via any of the emails that they have sent:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/inbox_newsletter_block.png"
    style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}
  />
</Frame>

We do recommend blocking newsletters the moment you realize that you do not want to receive them forever. Otherwise, it might be a good idea in being subscribed.
