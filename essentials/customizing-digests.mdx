## Basics

Ultimately, all newsletters, all youtube videos and all posts from other sources will be included in your Daily or Weekly digest, if you have subscribed to them(and haven't blocked them).

Currently, there are 2 settings that you can control: [Digest Frequency](#digest-frequency) and [How Compact the Digest is](#compact-digest-setting).

In the future (coming in Q3 2024), we are planning to build [Digest 2.0](https://summate.canny.io/feature-requests/p/digests-20-scheduling-curation-different-summarization-types), which will provide you with much more versatility in:

- how often you will receive digests;
- what's the format of it;
- what will be included there.

For more, please follow this [feature request](https://summate.canny.io/feature-requests/p/digests-20-scheduling-curation-different-summarization-types).

## Digest Frequency

You can choose between **daily** and **weekly** digest frequency in your [settings](https://summate.io/settings/notifications) page.

All digests are being sent on 11 AM UTC time. There might be some delay, but mostly it's due to the email provider. Alternatively, you can always open digests [in the web](https://summate.io/digest).

## Compact Digest Setting

You can choose to receive a **compact** or **extended** digest via email in your [settings](https://summate.io/settings/notifications) page.

The difference between formats is that in compact format, only TLDR of each post is included, while in the extended format, we also include clickable key takeaways.
