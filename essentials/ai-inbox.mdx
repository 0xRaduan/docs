## Basics

Once you onboard to Summate, we provide you with access to your AI inbox. In a nutshell, it's your personal email address, **but just for newsletters**.

It is under domain: `inbox.summate.io`, so the example of an address would be: `elon@inbox.summate.io`.

After you create it, you can treat it as a regular email address and:

- Send messages yourself to it.
- Forward messages to it.
- Use it to subscribe for newsletters.
- Use it to subscribe for other products.

All in all, the main goal of AI inbox is to [hide all the noise from your main inbox](/manifesto), while still giving you the ability to access this content on demand and [in the digests](/essentials/customizing-digests).

## Features

When an email lends to your inbox you can:

- approve it, so it will be included in your digests.
- block it, so you don't receive it in your digests.
- read all emails by sender.
- read summaries of each email / newsletter.

## Advanced Use-Cases

#### Click-to-Read Summarization

In March 2024 [we announced](https://summate.io/changelog) a **breakthrough summarization algorithm** that allows you to extract key ideas in the content, and then jump exactly to a part of the content where the key takeaway is extracted from.

Since then, it's powering summaries of all emails that are sent to your inbox.

#### Auto-Forwarding of Emails

One of the key features of AI inbox is the ability to [setup auto-forwarding of emails](/essentials/auto-forwarding) to your inbox address.

That way, you are in control, which newsletters you want to get in your digest.
